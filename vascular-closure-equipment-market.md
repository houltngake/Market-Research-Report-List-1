<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vascular Closure Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Approximators</li><li>Passive Approximators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vascular closure equipment market includes two primary types: active approximators and passive approximators. Active approximators utilize mechanical devices to actively close the vascular access site post-procedure, promoting quicker hemostasis and reducing complications. In contrast, passive approximators rely on natural bodily mechanisms to facilitate closure, often using sutures or sealants that allow the body to manage the healing process. Both types aim to enhance patient safety and comfort while minimizing recovery time following vascular interventions.</p></p>
